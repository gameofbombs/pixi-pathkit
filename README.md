# pixi-pathkit

Allows to use [pathkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pathkit-wasm) with PixiJS

Also, adds typings for pathkit

## Compatibility

It works with PixiJS v5. 

## Building

You will need to have [node][node] setup on your machine.

Make sure you have [yarn][yarn] installed:

    npm install -g yarn

Then you can install dependencies and build:

```bash
yarn
yarn build
```

That will output the built distributables to `./dist`.
